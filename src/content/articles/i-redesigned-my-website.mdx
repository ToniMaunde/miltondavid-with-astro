I like TailwindCSS. It's a great technology that promotes consistency across teams and works great for individuals too when it comes to prototyping.

But TailwindCSS also leads to repetitive and rigid CSS. So, I decided to code the redesign of my website using only vanilla CSS. It was great.

## Embracing the cascade - WIP

I know that most, if not all, CSS frameworks have resets, and resets are a way of using the cascade to define the behavior of child elements. The cascade allows for more, though.
