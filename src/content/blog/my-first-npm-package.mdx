import ArticleLink from "./link.tsx"

One day I was reading the MDN docs when I came accross the experimental <ArticleLink text="Array.prototype.group" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/group" /> function. It peaked my interest since once I had to write a several lines of code to accomplish a similar result when working on <ArticleLink text="minhamola" href="https://www.minhamola.com" /> ~ 2 years ago.

### Introduction

The first example on the docs was enough to make me think "what if I created a polyfill for this"? Check the package <ArticleLink text="here" href="https://github.com/ToniMaunde/array-group-polyfill" />. It actually wasn't a npm package at first, just a repository for sharing my approach to tackle the temporary lack of browser support for the group() function.

### Creating my first npm package

I was able to go from layman to newbie (levelled ðŸ†™) on all there is to know regarding creating and publishing npm packages, [automated] semver and Github actions for CI/CD. And this was only possible because I set out to share my ideas with others; this is why I believe that sharing our findings with others help us gain a better understanding on the topic at hand.

### Conclusion

My recommendation is for you to **work in public** and for the public. Whether you do it using just Github or via blog posts or tweets, just do it; the benefits that stem from this exercise are precious.
